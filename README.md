# ProjectRepo - Great Plates To-Eat (GPT)

## Group Members: Nathan Moes, Nicholas Scalzone, Alexander Novitchkov-Burbank, Jawaher Alsaiari

## Project Idea

### create a PWA that is built on react with a backend of python (or other if more viable).

### Our application will help the user decide on a dish to cook, then generate a recipe and provide an optimized shopping list based on price and availability at local stores.

## Our Minimum Viable Product: 
#### An application that will allow users to create an account, then interact with chat GPT through the application in a text based manner. The user will be guided to enter a prompt of what they would like to cook, filtering by keywords and dietary restrictions, in such a manner that the resulting response is a recommendation of 3 dishes they can choose from. Once a dish is chosen, the application automatically creates a recipe with a shopping list of ingredients. The user will then have the option to save the recipe to their account if they would like.

### User Stories:
